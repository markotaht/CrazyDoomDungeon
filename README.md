### On OSX:
If you encounter "LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application" error, you need to go into the package contents (right click, show package contents), Contents/MacOS/ and run a chmod +x on the file located in the MacOS folder from the terminal. Error can be seen if you try to run it from terminal.

Step by step:
1) Go to folder where you unpacked the zip
1) cd CDDV5_mac.app/Contents/MacOS/
1) chmod +x CDDV5_mac
1) open -a CDDV5_mac
